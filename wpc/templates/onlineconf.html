I'll cover how terminals work and show how to use terminal colors and styles, write to arbitrary portions of the screen, handle signals from the terminal, determine the size of the terminal. Examples will be in Python, but the techniques should be useful whenever you're in a terminal environment.</td>

Without the user even the most complicated, well-written code will never see the light of day. So, what is front-end design anyway? Where do design trends come from? How could a programmer possibly focus on the program itself yet still help design a great front end? All these questions answered and more in this talk! Tune in and find out!</td>
