{# FIX THIS TEXT -#}
Hey everyone! This is Alexander Putilin.

We're working on a number of interesting features on http://watchpeoplecode.com, and one of them is streaming with virtually no lag. We set up our own streaming server, and have been testing this semi-publicly through the last few of weeks. If you're interested in starting streaming, check this guide: http://watchpeoplecode.com/streaming_guide. We aren't going to disable adding your own twitch or youtube streams, so if you want to, you can still stream using Twitch or Youtube.
If you need help with streaming, email me at avp-13@yandex.ru.

Also, if you have some time this evening, these 7 livestreams that are available at the time of sending this email.

{% if live_streams -%}
  Live right now:

  {% for stream in live_streams %}
    {%- if stream.title -%} {{ stream.title }}: {% endif -%} {{ stream.normal_url() }}

  {% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if upcoming_streams -%}
  Upcoming today:

  {% for stream in upcoming_streams %}
    {%- if stream.scheduled_start_time -%} {{stream.format_start_time(countdown=False)}} {% endif %}
    {% if stream.title -%} {{ stream.title }}: {% endif -%} {{ stream.normal_url() }}

  {% endfor %}
