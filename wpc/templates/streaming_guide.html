    <h2><p class="text-center">Streaming Guide</p></h2>
    <p>
      This guide is under development. If you need help, you can message <a href="https://reddit.com/r/watchpeoplecode">/r/WatchPeopleCode</a> moderators or reach to <a href="https://reddit.com/u/godlikesme">/u/godlikesme</a> on irc.freenode.net #WatchPeopleCode.
    </p>
    <h3><p class="text-center">Twitch or YouTube</p></h3>
    <p>
      If you have YouTube channel or Twitch channel, you can submit a link to your stream to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/watchpeoplecode">/r/WatchPeopleCode</a> subreddit. It will be automatically detected and put on the website within minutes
    </p>
    <h3><p class="text-center">Streaming trough WatchPeopleCode's servers</p></h3>
    <p>
      WatchPeopleCode has its own server dedicated to streaming. The lag here is much smaller than on YouTube or Twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend this way because when streaming with WatchPeopleCode, you also have the ability to cross-stream to Twitch and YouTube (or any other RTMP server) at once!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>. OBS is a great piece of software that makes streaming easy. Using OBS you can stream on WatchPeopleCode (or YouTube, Twitch).</li>
      <li>Login with reddit and click on "My Dashboard".</li>
      <li>In your dashboard, click "Show private info".</li>
      <li>Add WPC RTMP URL and WPC RTMP key to OBS <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/watchpeoplecode/manual/obs-stream.png">(example)</a>.</li>
      <li>You can now stream on WPC just fine! If you want to further reduce lag, you can  <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/watchpeoplecode/manual/obs-download.png">use these settings</a>.</li>
      <li>Submit your link to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/watchpeoplecode">/r/WatchPeopleCode</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><p class="text-center">What can I stream here?</p></h3>
    <p>
      Pretty much anything related to programming! The most common stream format is just live programming (hence the name WatchPeopleCode).
